Installing from source
======================

Using git
+++++++++

We strongly recommend using git to clone the repository. This is the easiest and most effective way of ensuring that your system is up-to-date and is easily updateable.

Make sure you have git installed on your system and then navigate to the /opt directory on your serevr.

Run the following code to get OTRS 6 (at the time of this writting 6.0.6):

::

   git clone https://github.com/OTRS/otrs.git
   git checkout rel-6_0
